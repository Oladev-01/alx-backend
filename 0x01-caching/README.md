# 0x01. Caching
### ALX: Backend


## Description

This project explores the concept of caching in software systems, focusing on the different caching algorithms and strategies used to improve performance and efficiency. Caching is a powerful technique that stores a subset of data in a fast-access storage layer, enabling quicker data retrieval and reducing the load on the primary data source.

The tasks in this project will involve implementing various caching systems, comparing their efficiencies, and understanding their use cases in different scenarios.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the principles of caching and its importance in system performance.
- Implement different caching algorithms, including:
  - FIFO (First In, First Out)
  - LRU (Least Recently Used)
  - MRU (Most Recently Used)
  - LFU (Least Frequently Used)
- Compare and contrast these algorithms based on their performance in different contexts.
- Understand when and how to apply caching strategies in real-world applications.
- Integrate caching mechanisms into existing systems to enhance performance.

## Requirements

- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8 or later).
- Code should follow the PEP 8 style guide.
- Each caching algorithm should be implemented as a class with clear methods to `put` and `get` items.
- Unit tests should be included to validate the correctness of each caching implementation.
- A README.md file that explains the project and your approach to solving each task.

## Tasks

1. **Basic Cache**: Implement a simple cache with no eviction policy.
2. **FIFO Cache**: Implement a cache with a FIFO eviction policy.
3. **LRU Cache**: Implement a cache with an LRU eviction policy.
4. **MRU Cache**: Implement a cache with an MRU eviction policy.
5. **LFU Cache**: Implement a cache with an LFU eviction policy.
6. **Comparison**: Analyze and compare the performance of different caching strategies based on specific use cases.

## Usage

To run the caching implementations, you can use the following commands:

```bash
python3 your_cache_file.py
```

Make sure to replace `your_cache_file.py` with the actual file name containing your cache implementation.
